	Came up with this idea with a friend
	want it to happen so I'm trying
	I like accordions, i like you guys
	this could be good for everyone


about soundslice
	sync with youtube videos
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSTQZYU2Kso
	people can buy lessons
	teacher account to make lessons


what would need to happen
	nothing for right hand only lessons
	left-hand 120 bass keyboard


lesson volume - to convince adrian
	lessons made per month
	lessons given per month
	number of teachers
	number of students
	youtube lessons have many views

	5500 subscribers, 6000 views
	1600 estimate
	20 hours a week of lessons in person. 80/20 in person



next steps
