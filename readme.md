whole curriculum:
	a series of projects (not gitbook) - frontend, express, react
		- fully open source
	 	projects to be built in order
	 	completed asynchronously at student's own paces
	 	assigned one per 'phase' 
	 	everyone will be held roughly together by changing phases together
	parallel content gitbook - sections: git/hub, debugging, teamworking, ...
		- fully open source
	 	separate developerly skills, parallel to building projects
	 	all together lectures and daily assignments
	3 month schedule gitbook - links to parallel and projects gitbook  
		- how we curate the opensource components to fit our needs 
		a calendar which places the dripfed parallel content in an order 
		spreading each topic out over the 3 months
		designates when students should finish with one project gitbook and move on to the next, stopping as far as they made it
	phases - exist in concept only, not gitbooks
		conceptual jumps in app complexity
		contain sub-phases
		exist in the calendar only as a result of which day links to which content

-------------------------------------  projects  ------------------------------------

projects: - a repository of projects.
	all of them in a row

a project's readme:
	principle to learn in this project
	link to boiled down finished code.  ie
		just enough to do a hello world built with the principle
	link to resources
	they are to spec and rewrite the project as a full app

--------------------------------------  parallels  ------------------------------------

parallel content gitbooks:
	organized by topic
	within topic - resources, series of exercises, assessment...
	from beginner to advanced within each topic

------------------------------------  calendar  ------------------------------------

calendar:  (phases only exist because of these)
	marks end/beginning of phases
	organizes parallel content into daily lectures
	marks extra events like going out, national holidays, ...

------------------------------------  phases  ------------------------------------

phases: (only exist because the calendar links to the resources in phase order)
	Phase 0:  foundations of javascript and developing
		js foundations 			- parallel and projects 'foundations'
		frontend skills 		- parallel and projects 'front-end'
		pre-node 				- parallel
	Phase 1:  app design, express, adv. javascript		
		node 					- parallel and projects 'express'
		preact 					- parallel
	Phase 3:	
		react 					- parallel and projects 'react'
		final projects 			- parallel
